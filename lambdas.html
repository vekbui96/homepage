 <p><img src="images/tommyHeadshot.png" alt="tommyHeadshot" style="float: right;width:251px;height:170px;margin-right:15px;"> One Cold windy night, two gentlemen, Nam Doan and Anthony Nguyen went to visit the Alpha Omicron chapter of Lambda Phi Epsilon. They were curious as to what lambda LiFE was about. After that inspirational night, the two were determined to join Lambdas and recruited more men for the same cause. Thus, Altruistic Asian Association (AAA) was created on January 25th, 2012, as an interest group to charter Lambda Phi Epsilon. Nam reached out to the central expansion
chair, Thomas Nguyen, principal founder who chartered Oklahoma chapter. After numerous visits and meetings with Thomas, AAA participated in many philanthropic, fundraising, volunteering, brotherhood, and visited other chapters across the Southwest to show their dedication in chartering Lambda Phi Epsilon. After a year of their hard work and determination, AAA received a formal invitation to charter Lambda Phi Epsilon at The University of Texas at Arlington. IN the spring of 2013, twelve brave men went through “inspirational training’ with Oklahoma University as their host chapter. After their
hard work and dedication their dreams finally came true on April 7th, 2013, where Lambda Phi Epsilon was officially chartered at The University of Texas at Arlington.<br> <br> However, establishing the fraternity is only the begining. Once a fraternity is on campus, they would have to prove themselves inorder to be granted the status of being a fully fledged chapter. The academic school year of 2018-2019, Tommy has stepped up in multiple ways inorder for the Arlington Chapter to achive their current status.</p>
<h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Be The Match </h4>
<p><img src="images/bethematch.jpg" alt="bethematch" style="float: left;width:167px;height:217px;margin-right:15px;"> His first major contribution was to establishing their philantropy event called "Be the match water pong" where contestants can pay $10 in order to participate in a game of water pong. The winner of the tournament would be awarded $100 as a victory prize and all of the profits would be donated to "Be The Match". His contribution was establishing the fundamentals of the game, as well as working on the budget, organization of the event, as well as graphics such as the flier seen here. <br><br> The result of this event was a major success. The turnout was around 20 different teams and raised over $150 in donations. Additionally, plenty of new people were informed of the importance of being a bone marrow donor. They exceed their expected amount of people willing to sign up to be a bone marrow donor and had a total of 23 people sign up. <br><br> </p>

<h4 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Convention </h4>
<p><img src="images/convention.jpeg" alt="convention" style="float: right;width:480px;height:320px;margin-right:15px;"> 
  As time went by, it was time time apply to become a full fledge chapter. Although during the time Tommy was the treasurer, 
  he contributed and exceeding amount. One of the requirements was creating a packet that presents all of the chapters achivements from their establishment,
   to currently. <br><br> "We needed someone to make a status packet for us, but no one knew how to do it. W
   e didn't have the money to hire a professional and we were running out of options. Tommy took a class on how to use the program "InDesign"
    and created something that was on the levels of a professional" Kevin Tran -Arlington Lambda Phi Epsilon President <br><br> 
    Tommy made a packet that was equal to the level of a professional. When the packet was presented during their annual convention, 
    viewers were stunned on the professionalism.
