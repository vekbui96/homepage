      <p> My first job out of college was as an embedded software engineer at Lockheed Martin. I worked on the F-16 fighter jet as a full stack engineer. 
          The team I was on really focused down on OOP principals. I managed to contribute to the team by restructuring mutliple classes to make it easier 
          to make future modifications, increasing the teams overall efficiency. I took leadership rolls here where I had my own intern that shadowed me and I taught how
          her how to write scripts, program using C++, and gave college advice to. We had practiced agile principals and I managed to be a scrum master for a couple of months before
          I left the company. At the end of the first year, I was giving a rating of "â€œSignificantly Achieved" which was nearly imposible at the time as a level 1 engineer. We used
          plenty of applications such as Jira, Jenkins, Rhapsody, and Demensions. As far as languages I got experice with C++, Java, Python and many more.
